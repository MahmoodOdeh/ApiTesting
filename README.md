# ApiTesting
Deck of Cards API Automation
This project provides automation for testing the Deck of Cards API (https://deckofcardsapi.com/). 
It includes a basic API wrapper, logic for making API calls, and tests designed according to the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert).
The tests perform data validation and status validation, and include parameterized tests.
